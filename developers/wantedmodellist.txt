if you have a mapmodel you would like, just add it into this list, and gear MIGHT make one when he feels like it.

arranged in urgency level

* doors with opening, and mapmodel animations. kinda sci-fi ish. see door1.jpg for a messy concept drawing.
* Elevator/Platform models, something like out of jak and daxter (a round thing that hovers or has some fire or something underneath it) would be quite cool.
* More Varieties of trees, from small ferns to huge overgrown oaks and willows.
* A waterwheel, like those medieval kind that spins around as a stream pushes it.
