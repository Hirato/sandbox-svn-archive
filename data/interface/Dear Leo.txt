Dear Leo, this is your todo list for the moment, as you requested.

1. tweak the checkbox and radio icons to on average, feature lighter shades of greens and reds
2. Improved backgrounds for UIExpandable, TextEditor, and UIField objects.
3. Use a different (perferably darker) colour for the titlebar - also make it solid. It doesn't really distinguish itself enough from the tabs right underneath it.


Game icons are optional, but if you want to do
them, higher quality "invest" and "revert" icons will be appreciated. For the former, a +5 variant will too.
