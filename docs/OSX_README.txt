Platinum Arts Sandbox 2.2.4 Mac binary

To use the OSX_Launcher you must rename the Sandbox Multiplatform folder to "sandbox", then move the OSX_Launcher.app outside (to the same level as) the renamed folder.

Alternately, you can double click sandbox.app to launch the program with default settings.
